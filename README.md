# Predicting_Customer_Churn

This project is working with a telecom customer usage dataset to build a binary classification model to predict customer churn.

In particular, machine learning models like random forest, SVM and logistic regression are applied with GridSearch. **And the best model is selected with Recall metric.**

Business recommendations for stakeholders are proposed.

Apart from sklearn models, H2O AutoML is also applied in search for the best performant model.

Look at the Colab in the repository for more details!
